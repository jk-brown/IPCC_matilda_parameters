This is a project to try and determine a parameter set that, when used for Hector, falls in line with IPCC AR6 WG1 warming values. 

Notes and TO DO:
We have saved a .csv of what is currently a preliminary parameter set to produce results that align with the 2081-2100 assessed warming values for IPCC AR6.

TO DO:
1. Use the parameter set in a fresch Hector + Matilda run to see if the results are as expected - i.e., match the reuslts from the analysis so far.
2. Compute the Hector + matilda warming values for all time periods across SSPs to see if short and mid-term warming ranges still match IPCC as well as the long-term ranges do.
3. Visualizations to show alignment with IPCC (I should be able to find this data somewhere).
